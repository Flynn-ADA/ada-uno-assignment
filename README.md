# ADA (uno style) Card Game


## Challenge Outline
As part of this challenge, I was tasked with the creation of my own, approved, individual advanced computersystem, application, or game. As part of this challenge, I chose to create a basic Uno style card game using React, MUI and typescript. 

### UML Style Diagram
I created a UML Style Diagram illustrating my initial overall solution

### Trello Board
I used a Trello board in order to break down the requirements of the task into smaller, epic style tickets. This allowed me to plan out my approach for the task

### Initial Working Plan
My Initial working plan was to use a Fail Fast Agile approach. Developing an MVP and iterating on this design in order to produce a high quality product. For each of my components and features, I would create detailed epics on Trello, in order for me to create the component to the best of my ability. I have My trello board contained the sections "TO DO", "DOING", "DONE", "REFACTOR", and "ARCHIVED". The Refactor column allowed my to follow an agile approach and refine my application as it was being built. This allowed me to manage the quality of my product. I would work on my project almost daily in order to make sure that I fulfilled the client requirements.

### Initital OO Design Ideas
Initially, I knew I wanted to create a player class. This was so I could easily mutate the data of a given player. I knew that I wanted to create a member function that allowed the user to draw a card. I knew that I wanted to have this card fabricated from within another class (card class). This class handled the random card creation using private member functions to break down the class into smaller, easier to understand components. I knew I was going to face challenges by using an OOP approach with react, as it is an outdated approach with react. 

## Development
During my development process, I needed to make sure that I was adopting 'good' standards. Including no duplication of code, separated files, use of a linter for formatting, avoiding deep nesting, naming formats and more. I separated all the components and classes I could, into separate files in order to make sure that the codebase is not overcrowded and it is as neat as possible. I used a linter to make sure my code was formatted nicely, including using semi-colons, spacing, line breaks and more.
